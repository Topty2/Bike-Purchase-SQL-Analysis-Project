# Bike-Purchase-SQL-Analysis-Project
# Project Overview
This repository contains SQL queries and analysis to gain insights into a dataset related to bike purchases. The goal of the analysis is to explore the dataset and generate meaningful statistics about bike purchases based on various demographic and behavioral factors. These include age, region, income, marital status, commute distance, and more.

The dataset provides information on customers who have purchased or not purchased a bike, along with attributes that help segment them. 
## Project Description
The SQL queries in this project focus on providing useful insights related to bike purchases. The analysis includes:

- **Total Bikes Purchased:** Count the number of bikes purchased.
- **Purchase by Age Group:** Count the number of purchases by different age groups.
- **Purchase by Region:** Analyze the number of bike purchases across various regions.
- **Bike Purchases by Marital Status:** Group purchases by marital status.
- **Bike Purchases by Income:** Group purchases by customer income.
- **Bike Purchases by Commute Distance:** Analyze bike purchases based on commute distance.
- **Bike Purchases by Number of Cars Owned:** Look at how the number of cars owned impacts bike purchases.
  
# Bike Purchase Analysis Summary
- Out of the 1,026 samples, 495 were purchased, which is about 48.2% of the total bikes.
- The **Middle Age** group has the highest bike purchases with **631** bikes, followed by the **Old** group with **283** bikes, and the **Adolescent** group with the lowest at **112** bikes.
- In **North America**, about **43%** of bikes were purchased, suggesting moderate interest; in the **Pacific**, **59%** of bikes were purchased, indicating stronger demand; and in **Europe**, **49%** were purchased, reflecting a balanced purchasing trend.
- Among Singles, 259 bikes were purchased out of 477, indicating a higher purchase rate compared to the Married group, where 236 bikes were purchased out of 549, suggesting that Singles are more likely to purchase bikes than Married individuals.
- The highest number of bike purchases occurred at an income of $40,000 with 94 bikes purchased, while purchases decrease with higher incomes, with only 1 bike purchased at $170,000, suggesting that lower-income groups are more likely to purchase bikes compared to higher-income groups.
- The highest number of bike purchases occurred for those commuting 0-1 miles with 207 bikes purchased, indicating that shorter commutes are more likely to drive bike purchases, while those commuting Above 10 miles had the fewest purchases at 33, suggesting that longer commutes may discourage bike usage.
- The highest number of bike purchases occurred among individuals who own 1 car with 159 bikes purchased, followed by those who own 0 cars with 153 bikes purchased, suggesting that people with fewer or no cars are more likely to purchase bikes, while those with 2 or more cars have fewer bike purchases, indicating a potential preference for car use over biking.
